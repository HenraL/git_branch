# Git Branch

## About

This program is a set of small scripts that I wrote in bash to help you automate some parts of the process to manage github branches.

These bash scripts can be called individually.

It is also possible to call the `git_branch` script that centralises all the scripts.

## Supported Systems

    - Linux
    - MacOS (not tested)
    - Windows (might work if run under a bash environement)

## Installation (not yet tested)

The installation file, requires an active internet connection to function.
This program will require a linux (or similar) environement to function:

- Download the `install_program`
- Give the file execution rights with `chmod +x install_program`
- Run the file with `sudo ./install_program`
- When prompted, enter your account's password so that the program can install its files.
